# Definition of a stack

## LIFO last in first out

# Big O

- Insertion O(1)
- Removal O(1)
- Searching O(n)
- Access O(n)

# use cases:

1. Managing function invocations
2. Undo / Redo
3. Routing(this history object) is treated like a stack

In the stack.js I will use Array and LinkedList to do the stack implementation
