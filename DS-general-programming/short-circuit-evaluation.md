# short-circuit evaluation

Short-circuit evaluation is a strategy most programming languages (including JavaScript) use to avoid unnecessary work. For example, say we had a conditional like this:

```
if (itIsFriday && itIsRaining) {
  console.log('board games at my place!');
}
```

Let's say itIsFriday is false. Because JavaScript short-circuits evaluation, it wouldn't bother checking the value of itIsRainingâ€”it knows that either way the condition is false and we won't print the invitation to board game night.

We can use this to our advantage. For example, say we have a check like this:

```
if (friends['Becky'].isFreeThisFriday()) {
  inviteToBoardGameNight(friends['Becky']);
}
```

What happens if 'Becky' isn't in our friends object? Since friends['Becky'] is undefined, when we try to call isFreeThisFriday() we'll get a TypeError.

Instead, we could first confirm that Becky and I are still on good terms:

```
if (friends.hasOwnProperty('Becky') && friends['Becky'].isFreeThisFriday()) {
inviteToBoardGameNight(friends['Becky']);
}
```

This way, if 'Becky' isn't in friends, JavaScript will ignore the rest of the conditional and avoid throwing the TypeError.
