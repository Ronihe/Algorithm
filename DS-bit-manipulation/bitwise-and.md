# Bitwise AND

The AND operation takes two bits and returns 11 if both bits are 11. Otherwise, it returns 00.

1 & 1 → 1

1 & 0 → 0

0 & 1 → 0

0 & 0 → 0

Think of it like a hose with two knobs. Both knobs must be set to on for water to come out.

When performing AND on two integers, the AND operation is calculated on each pair of bits (the two bits at the same index in each number).
```
5 & 6 // gives 4

// at the bit level:
// 0101 (5)
// & 0110 (6)
// = 0100 (4)
```
