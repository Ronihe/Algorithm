# Comparison with List

1. List is linear Trees is not linear

4. Siblings -A group of nodes with the same parent.
5. Leaf - A node with no children.
6. Edge - The connection between one node and another.

# KINDS OF TREES

- Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees

# Trees

- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Artificial Intelligence
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems

## Binary Trees

- Decision Trees (true / false)
- Database Indicies
- Sorting Algorithms

# BINARY SEARCH TREES

- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
