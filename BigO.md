# Big O notation

### measure the code's efficiency

# Term:

1. n: the size of the input
2. runtime:

## the idea about big O is to measure how long an algoo takes to run. when we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a prob.

- not details but focus on what is basically happenning
- runtime - how quickly it grws relative to the input, as the inpt gets arbitrarily large

# Examples:

```
  function printFirstItem(items) {
  console.log(items[0]);
}
```

the func runs in O(1) or constant time relative to its input
