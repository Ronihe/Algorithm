# Interview prep resources

principles:

1. coding everyday: stay excited about what you doing
2. master at least one language: familiar with everything about this language, you are at least very comfotable with the language to do the whiteboard
3. re-invent the wheel: tere are many ways to implement the same thing, get a better idea how the language is structrued and idioms are

```
You should implement the most common data structures in your language of choice. Do not rely on common libraries. 
Implement the following and write tests for them: vector (dynamic array), linked list, stack, queue, circular queue, 
hash map, set, priority queue, binary search tree, etc. You should be able to implement them quickly.
```

4. know the complexities. by fixing problems: solve world problems
5. always ask questions early: what is good look like, get as much info as you can
6. being assertive and open-minded the same time. be assertive about what you already know, be curious, this is a chance for you to learn from the interviewer. being passionate.
