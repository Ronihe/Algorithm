### Game intro:
two approaches:
1. top-down
    we look at the design, treat the many of the modules as "black box"(until later)
2. bottom-up:
    understand the details first
    
    
best to combine top-down and bottom-up understanding: get an understanding of the high-level components of the system, and then drill down into the details of particular components as necessary.
