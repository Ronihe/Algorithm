### hash map:

similar to key-value storage 

O(1) to get some value
O(1) to set some value

-- O(1) here is actually O(size of the key)

### hash function
conver the string to the hash codes, hash values, digits or simply hashes

The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table.

### hash collision
- open hashing
 liked list to connect
- close hashing
