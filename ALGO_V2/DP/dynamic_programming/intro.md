## for situations
1. max/min
2. sum
3. True or False


# not for situations
1. return all the situations
2.  
3. 

## Four factors:
1. state: use f[i] or f[i][j] stands for the answer for the smaller size 

2. formula: 
- break down the question into smaller questions, 
- f[i][j] smaller state to get max/min/sum/or 

3. init:
    - exit of the recursion
    - cannot get any smaller
    - f[i][0] or f[0][i]
    
4. answer
    - the answer of the problem
    - ex. f[n][m] or max(...)
    
### coordination 
- state: coordination
- formula: the way it moves
- init: f[0][0]
- answer: target coordination
example: triangle

### imrpove the space complexity
